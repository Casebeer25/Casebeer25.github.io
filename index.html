    <div><p>My goals for my career are to work soley out of the oil field. I would like to do something that i can be home with my family and take more of a roll in my kids sports and activities.
        i would also like to be remote and take more trips with my kids and let them see the world.
    I would also like to do some sort of security work or design to have something I've built and can leave my stamp on, and also have the kids something to show the worl that dad did this. </p></div>
